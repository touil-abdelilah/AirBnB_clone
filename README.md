# AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter

Welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! This project aims to build a simplified version of AirBnB's backend functionality, focusing on managing objects such as users, listings, and bookings through a command-line interface.

## Introduction

The AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter provides a user-friendly interface to manage various objects within the AirBnB ecosystem. Users can create new objects, retrieve existing ones, perform operations, update attributes, and delete objects seamlessly.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd airbnb-clone
   ```

3. Run the command interpreter:
   ```
   python console.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the command interpreter is running, you can type commands followed by arguments to perform various operations on AirBnB objects. Use the `help` command to see a list of available commands and their usage.

## Command List

- `create`: Create a new object (e.g., User, Place).
- `show`: Retrieve an object by its ID.
- `destroy`: Delete an object by its ID.
- `update`: Update attributes of an object.
- `all`: Retrieve all objects of a certain type.
- `count`: Count the number of objects of a certain type.
- `quit` or `EOF`: Exit the command interpreter.

## File Structure

The project follows a structured layout for easy navigation:

```
airbnb-clone/
│
├── models/          # Contains classes for AirBnB objects
│   ├── base_model.py
│   ├── user.py
│   ├── place.py
│   └── ...
│
├── tests/           # Unit tests for classes and functionality
│   ├── test_base_model.py
│   ├── test_user.py
│   ├── test_place.py
│   └── ...
│
├── console.py       # Main command-line interface
└── ...
```

## Testing

Unit tests are provided to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Learning Objectives

By working on this project, you will gain knowledge and skills in the following areas:

- Creating a Python package
- Implementing a command interpreter using the `cmd` module
- Writing and executing unit tests in a large project
- Serializing and deserializing classes
- Working with JSON files
- Handling datetime and UUID in Python
- Understanding and using `*args` and `**kwargs` in functions
