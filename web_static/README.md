## What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages.

HTML Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
```

## What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to define the presentation and layout of HTML documents.

CSS Example:
```css
p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

## How to add style to an element?
You can apply CSS styles directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute or define styles in a separate CSS file.

Inline Style Example:
```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This paragraph has blue text and a font size of 16 pixels.</p>
```

## What is the DOM?
The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects, enabling dynamic access and manipulation of the document's content, structure, and style.

## What is an element / tag?
HTML elements, also known as tags, define different parts of a webpage. They are enclosed in angle brackets `< >` and come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.

## What is an attribute?
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are placed within the opening tag. They consist of a name and a value.

## What is a class?
A class is a way to apply a specific set of styles to one or more HTML elements. Classes are defined in CSS using a period (.) followed by the class name.

## What is a selector?
A selector is a pattern used to select HTML elements to which a set of CSS styles will be applied. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, or relationship with other elements.

## How does the browser load a webpage?
When a URL is entered into a web browser, the browser sends a request to the server hosting the webpage. The server responds by sending back the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources required to render the webpage.

## How to compute CSS Specificity Value?
CSS specificity determines which styles take precedence when multiple conflicting styles are applied to the same element. Specificity is calculated based on the combination of type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and inline styles.

## What are Box properties in CSS?
Box properties in CSS control the layout and dimensions of an element's box model, including properties like width, height, margin, padding, border, and position.

## Learn to Code HTML & CSS
Learning HTML and CSS is essential for web development. Start with basic concepts and gradually progress to more advanced topics like layout techniques, responsive design, and CSS frameworks.

## Specifics on CSS Specificity
Understanding CSS specificity is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable stylesheets. Mastering specificity rules will help you avoid unexpected styling issues and create cleaner, more organized CSS code.

## CSS SpeciFishity
CSS SpeciFishity humorously highlights the importance of understanding specificity in CSS. While specificity rules can be tricky, they are essential for effective styling.

## Introduction to HTML
HTML is the foundation of web development, allowing you to create structured and semantically meaningful content for the web. Mastering HTML will enable you to build engaging and accessible web experiences.

## MDN
MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and guides on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, MDN provides valuable resources for building successful web projects.

## Center Boxes
Centering boxes in CSS can be achieved using various techniques like the `margin` property with `auto` values, the `flexbox` layout model, or the `grid` layout system. Centering elements ensures visual balance and alignment, enhancing the design of your webpage.
